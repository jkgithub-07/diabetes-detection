# diabetes-detection

📌 Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical attributes using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and more.

🚀 Key Features:

✅ Predicts diabetes risk based on input health parameters

✅ Uses Logistic Regression, a simple yet effective classification algorithm

✅ Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy

✅ Provides data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

📂 Dataset
The model is trained on the Diabetes prediction dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes the following features:
age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

🚀 Usage
You can run the model using the provided Jupyter Notebook or a Python script.

📊 Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using Scikit-Learn's LogisticRegression and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

💡 Key Steps in Model Training:

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting data
Model Training – Fitting Logistic Regression to the training set
Evaluation – Checking model performance with metrics
📌 Accuracy Score: ~95% 

🏗️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
